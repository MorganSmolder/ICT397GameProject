Update Number 1,000,000

The matrix math interface has now been integrated with the main class system.

I've also written a scripted lua controls interface, which allows for control binding on a per-scene basis.

See demo three for usage.

Controls:
movement: as before
Change scene: the 'o' or 'O' (capital 'o') key

Purpose:
Illustrates the benifit of multiple cameras and flexibility of scene management interface.
